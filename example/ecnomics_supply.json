At the same time, a viral avocado trend increased the demand, and diesel prices were high, raising trucking costs. Without the strike-driven shortage as the main reason, wholesale avocado prices rose only slightly and retailers increased shelf prices modestly; customers still bought avocados and stores did not ration purchases.",
      "S_prime": "Shipments arrived as scheduled, so grocery stores had plenty of supply. At the same time, the viral avocado trend faded and diesel prices were low, reducing trucking costs. Because demand was weak and logistics were cheap, wholesale avocado prices fell and retailers cut shelf prices; customers bought more avocados and stores remained well-stocked for everyone.",
