At the same time, a new remote-work policy at a large employer increased local demand for housing in the city. With borrowing costs staying low, more buyers went ahead with purchases, so home prices rose more and rents increased, which still tightened some household budgets. Local restaurants still saw a small drop in weekday lunch sales as higher rents and other costs squeezed spending.",

At the same time, a new remote-work policy at a large employer increased local demand for housing in the city. Because borrowing costs remained low, more buyers rushed to make purchases, and because demand also rose, home prices surged significantly and rents rose sharply.
