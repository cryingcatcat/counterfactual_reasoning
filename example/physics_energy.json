Because the heater ran on high, the room warmed up quickly. Because the air was very dry, moisture evaporated faster, so the room felt less comfortable. Even though the room got warm, Lucy still turned the heater off early because the dryness made her uncomfortable.",

Because the heater ran on low, the room warmed up slowly. Because the air was very dry, moisture evaporated more gradually, so the room remained more comfortable. Since the room warmed up without the intense dryness, Lucy kept the heater on for much longer.",
