Separately, Brand’s employer started flexible work hours, which spread commuting across the morning and slightly reduced the rush-hour crush. Because buses were still slower but congestion was somewhat spread out, bus ridership stayed similar or fell only slightly that month.",

With the same number of cars, average traffic speed stayed low and bus travel times remained long. Separately, Brand’s employer started flexible work hours, which spread commuting across the morning. Because buses were still slow despite commuting being more spread out, fewer riders chose the bus that month.",
