Because they slept poorly, Lucy’s reaction time was slower in early fights. Because they skipped replay review, their draft left them with a weaker teamfight combo and they missed key timing windows. With slower reactions and weaker timings, Lucy’s team lost two early skirmishes and fell behind in net worth by 10 minutes.",
